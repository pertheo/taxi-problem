# Program with Q-Learning algorithm that solves the Taxi problem.

The program consists of 3 parts:
1.	Training program. It accepts algorithm parameters, display some quality metric (e.g. episode reward) during training and save the trained model.
2.	Visualisation program. It is able to load the model saved by the training program and display the environment state while the loaded model controls the actions of the agent.
3.	Trained model with joblib extension (created first time after running training program).
